# BoulderBlast - Michael Germano, Winter 2015
This program recreates the 1990's arcade game "Boulder Dash." This project centers around the use of C++ inheritance and polymorphism.

The files Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, and StudentWorld.cpp were modified by the student. The other files in this project were supplied by the Professor Smallberg.
